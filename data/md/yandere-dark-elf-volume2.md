Depending on your GitBase setup, you might be able to manage additional metadata for your articles:

- Tags or Categories
- Featured Image
- Publication Date
- Author Information

Look for these options in the article editor and fill them out as needed.

## Syncing with GitHub

After saving or creating an article:

1. GitBase will automatically sync your changes with the configured GitHub repository.
2. A new Markdown file will be created (for new articles) or updated (for edits) in the `data/md/` directory of your repository.
3. The `articles.json` file in the `data/json/` directory will also be updated to reflect the changes.

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Saving**: Save your work frequently to prevent loss of content.
2. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain a consistent style across your articles for a professional look.
3. **Optimized Titles and Descriptions**: Write clear, SEO-friendly titles and descriptions.
4. **Image Optimization**: If including images, ensure they are optimized for web use.
5. **Proofreading**: Always proofread your articles before publishing.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while managing articles:

1. **Changes Not Saving**: Check your internet connection and try again. If the problem persists, try refreshing the page and re-entering your changes.
2. **Formatting Issues**: If your Markdown isn't rendering correctly, double-check your syntax.
3. **Sync Errors**: If changes aren't reflecting in GitHub, verify your GitHub token permissions and repository settings.

By following these guidelines, you should be able to effectively manage articles on your GitBase website through the admin panel. Remember, all your content is version-controlled through GitHub, allowing for easy tracking of changes and the ability to revert if necessary.
