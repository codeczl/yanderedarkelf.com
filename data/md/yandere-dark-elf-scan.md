# Yandere Dark Elf Scan: A Closer Look at Maribelle’s World

Someone had shared an image of Maribelle’s intense glare as she proclaimed her undying love for Hinata. It wasn’t just her words that caught my attention—it was the artistry, the way her crimson eyes practically leapt off the page. I knew right then I had to dive deeper into this story.
